                "Expressing the dynamics of a ship as an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is a well established technique. The ODE can be solved as an initial value problem with integration of accelerations and velocities to obtain a ship's trajectory. This is commonly known as a simulation. The workflow of a simulation is to first establish a force model that can estimate the hydrodynamic forces as function of the current state. Accelerations can then be calculated from these forces together with the mass. The velocities and positions can then be determined with time integration of the acceleration.\n",
