      "abstract": "Demanding marine operations increase the complexity of maneuvering. A highly accurate dynamic ship model promotes predicting ship motions and advancing control safety for the offshore ship systems. It is crucial to identify the uncertain hydrodynamic coefficients under environmental disturbance to establish accurate mathematical models. In this paper, the identification procedure for a 3 degree of freedom hydrodynamic model under disturbance is completed based on the support vector machine method with multiple maneuvers datasets. The algorithm is validated on the clean ship model and the results present good fitness with the reference. Experiments in different sea states are designed and conducted to investigate the effects of the turbulence on the identified model fidelity. Generalization results show that the models identified in the gentle and moderate environments have less than 10% deviations and are considered allowable. The higher perturbations, the lower fidelity of the identified model. Models identified under disturbance could provide different levels of reliable support for the operation decision system.",
